If you think it's not justified, it's too expensive. \\n\\nPersonally, I think P/E in isolation tells you very little and you might want a more comprehensive look at the stock to evaluate it.\\nI personally find that PE only shows half of the truth.

I did really well shorting cloud software in 2021 into 2022.  I do shares and puts but ive never really made money on puts, the timing is too difficult.  Its not easy, I got beat on last year shorting and had to write down some losses.  \\n\\nI do think theres opportunity at these elevated levels on some hype stuff. \\n\\nI see MDB, DDOG, CRWD, SNOW, TEAM, SHOP, NOW and a couple others on my list.  Almost all are trading above 20 p/s. A downturn on customer software spending is going to hit these hard.  The bull side is that the bubble can keep going for a lot longer, possibly years.  I dont short biotech, small caps, or try to short anything headed for Bankruptcy because of the short squeeze potential.  Also, nothing with high short interest.
