         "Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\".\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \"did a good job and I didn't\".\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\nVettel said: \"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\"\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\nThe 24-year-old said: \"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\n\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\"\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\"\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\", adding: \"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\"\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\nTodt said he was \"optimistic\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\n\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\" Rosberg said. \"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\"\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\nBahrain GP qualifying results\nBahrain GP coverage details",

I don't mind if it is two weeks or six.\"\nGundogan made 15 appearances and scored five goals in his debut season for City following his £20m move from Borussia Dortmund.\nHe is eager to get on the field again and was impressed at the club's 4-1 win over Real Madrid in a pre-season game in Los Angeles on Wednesday.\nManager Pep Guardiola has made five new signings already this summer and continues to have an interest in Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez and Monaco's Kylian Mbappe.\nGundogan said: \"Optimism for the season is big. It is huge, definitely.\n\"We felt that last year as well but it was a completely new experience for all of us. We know the Premier League a bit more now and can't wait for the season to start.\"\nCity complete their three-match tour of the United States against Tottenham in Nashville on Saturday.\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte said earlier this week he did not feel Tottenham were judged by the same standards as his own side, City and Manchester United.\nSpurs have had the advantage in their recent meetings with City, winning three and drawing one of their last four Premier League games.\nAnd Gundogan thinks they are a major threat.\nHe said: \"Tottenham are a great team. They have the style of football. They have young English players. Our experience last season shows it is really tough to beat them.\n\"They are really uncomfortable to play against.\n\"I am pretty sure, even if they will not say it loud, the people who know the Premier League know Tottenham are definitely a competitor for the title.\"",

         "Lewis Hamilton stormed to pole position at the Bahrain Grand Prix ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg.",
         "Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\".\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \"did a good job and I didn't\".\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\nVettel said: \"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\"\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\nThe 24-year-old said: \"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\n\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\"\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\"\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\", adding: \"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\"\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\nTodt said he was \"optimistic\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\n\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\" Rosberg said. \"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\"\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\nBahrain GP qualifying results\nBahrain GP coverage details"

         "Manchester City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan says it has been mentally tough to overcome a third major injury.",
         "Gundogan, 26, told BBC Sport he \"can see the finishing line\" after tearing cruciate knee ligaments in December, but will not rush his return.\nThe German missed the 2014 World Cup following back surgery that kept him out for a year, and sat out Euro 2016 because of a dislocated kneecap.\nHe said: \"It is heavy mentally to accept that.\"\nGundogan will not be fit for the start of the Premier League season at Brighton on 12 August but said his recovery time is now being measured in \"weeks\" rather than months.\nHe told BBC Sport: \"It is really hard always to fall and fight your way back. You feel good and feel ready, then you get the next kick.\n\"The worst part is behind me now. I want to feel ready when I am fully back. I want to feel safe and confident. I don't mind if it is two weeks or six.\"\nGundogan made 15 appearances and scored five goals in his debut season for City following his £20m move from Borussia Dortmund.\nHe is eager to get on the field again and was impressed at the club's 4-1 win over Real Madrid in a pre-season game in Los Angeles on Wednesday.\nManager Pep Guardiola has made five new signings already this summer and continues to have an interest in Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez and Monaco's Kylian Mbappe.\nGundogan said: \"Optimism for the season is big. It is huge, definitely.\n\"We felt that last year as well but it was a completely new experience for all of us. We know the Premier League a bit more now and can't wait for the season to start.\"\nCity complete their three-match tour of the United States against Tottenham in Nashville on Saturday.\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte said earlier this week he did not feel Tottenham were judged by the same standards as his own side, City and Manchester United.\nSpurs have had the advantage in their recent meetings with City, winning three and drawing one of their last four Premier League games.\nAnd Gundogan thinks they are a major threat.\nHe said: \"Tottenham are a great team. They have the style of football. They have young English players. Our experience last season shows it is really tough to beat them.\n\"They are really uncomfortable to play against.\n\"I am pretty sure, even if they will not say it loud, the people who know the Premier League know Tottenham are definitely a competitor for the title.\""

    "Hints in case you feel stuck on this task:\n",
    "* Some models can handle *a lot* of languages.  Check out [NLLB](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/nllb), the No Language Left Behind model ([research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04672)).\n",
    "* The \"translation\" task for `pipeline` takes optional parameters `src_lang` (source language) and `tgt_lang` (target language), which are important when the model can handle multiple languages.  To figure out what codes to use to specify languages (and scripts for those languages), it can be helpful to find existing examples of using your model; for NLLB, check out [this Python script with codes](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Geonmo/nllb-translation-demo/blob/main/flores200_codes.py) or similar demo resources.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. High-level instruction about the task\n",

    "1. New query\n",

    "More specifically, your prompt should follow this template:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<High-level instruction about the task: Given input_label, generate output_label.>:\n",
    "\n",
    "[<input_label>]: \"<input text>\"\n",

    "* Translation: This is easy but less interesting since there are already models fine-tuned for translation.  You can generate examples via a tool like Google Translate.\n",
    "* Create book titles or descriptions: Given a book title, generate a description, or vice versa.  You can get examples off of Wikipedia.\n",
    "* Generate tweets: Given keywords or a key message, generate a tweet.\n",

    "* Model\n",
    "  * `do_sample`: True or False.  This tells the model whether or not to use sampling in generation.  If False, then it will do greedy search or beam search.  If True, then it will do random sampling which can optionally use the top-p and/or top-k sampling techniques.  See the blog post linked below for more details on sampling techniques.\n",
    "  * `num_beams`: (for beam search) This specifies the number of beams to use in beam search across possible sequences.  Increasing the number can help the model to find better sequences, at the cost of more computation.\n",
    "  * `min_length`, `max_length`: Generative models can be instructed to generate new text between these token lengths.\n",
    "  * `top_k`: (for sampling) This controls the use of top-K sampling, which forces sampling to ignore low-probability tokens by limiting to the K most probable next tokens.  Set to 0 to disable top-K sampling.\n",
    "  * `top_p`: (for sampling) This controls the use of top-p sampling, which forces sampling to ignore low-probability tokens by limiting to the top tokens making up probability mass p.  Set to 0 to disable top-p sampling.\n",
    "  * `temperature`: (for sampling) This controls the \"temperature\" of the softmax.  Lower values bias further towards high-probability next tokens.  Setting to 0 makes sampling equivalent to greedy search.\n",
    "* Tokenizer decoding\n",
    "  * `skip_special_tokens`: True or False.  This allows you to skip special tokens (like EOS tokens) in the model outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not tweak:\n",
    "* Tokenizer encoding\n",
    "  * `padding`: True or False.  This helps to handle variable-length inputs by adding padding to short inputs.  Since it should be set according to your task and data, you should not change it for this exercise (unless you want to see what warnings or error may appear).\n",
    "  * `truncation`: True or False.  This helps to handle variable-length inputs by truncating very long inputs.  Since it should be set according to your task and data, you should not change it for this exercise (unless you want to see what warnings or error may appear).\n",

This feature is intended for advanced users.\n        stopping_criteria (`StoppingCriteriaList`, *optional*):\n            Custom stopping criteria that complement the default stopping criteria built from arguments and a\n            generation config. If a stopping criteria is passed that is already created with the arguments or a\n            generation config an error is thrown. This feature is intended for advanced users.\n        prefix_allowed_tokens_fn (`Callable[[int, torch.Tensor], List[int]]`, *optional*):\n            If provided, this function constraints the beam search to allowed tokens only at each step. If not\n            provided no constraint is applied. This function takes 2 arguments: the batch ID `batch_id` and\n            `input_ids`. It has to return a list with the allowed tokens for the next generation step conditioned\n            on the batch ID `batch_id` and the previously generated tokens `inputs_ids`. This argument is useful\n            for constrained generation conditioned on the prefix, as described in [Autoregressive Entity\n            Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00904).\n        synced_gpus (`bool`, *optional*):\n            Whether to continue running the while loop until max_length. Unless overridden this flag will be set to\n            `True` under DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 3 multiple GPUs environment to avoid hanging if one GPU finished\n            generating before other GPUs. Otherwise it'll be set to `False`.\n        streamer (`BaseStreamer`, *optional*):\n            Streamer object that will be used to stream the generated sequences. Generated tokens are passed\n            through `streamer.put(token_ids)` and the streamer is responsible for any further processing.\n    \n        kwargs:\n            Ad hoc parametrization of `generate_config` and/or additional model-specific kwargs that will be\n            forwarded to the `forward` function of the model. If the model is an encoder-decoder model, encoder\n            specific kwargs should not be prefixed and decoder specific kwargs should be prefixed with *decoder_*.\n    \n    Return:\n        [`~utils.ModelOutput`] or `torch.LongTensor`: A [`~utils.ModelOutput`] (if `return_dict_in_generate=True`\n        or when `config.return_dict_in_generate=True`) or a `torch.FloatTensor`.\n    \n            If the model is *not* an encoder-decoder model (`model.config.is_encoder_decoder=False`), the possible\n            [`~utils.ModelOutput`] types are:\n    \n                - [`~generation.GreedySearchDecoderOnlyOutput`],\n                - [`~generation.SampleDecoderOnlyOutput`],\n                - [`~generation.BeamSearchDecoderOnlyOutput`],\n                - [`~generation.BeamSampleDecoderOnlyOutput`]\n    \n            If the model is an encoder-decoder model (`model.config.is_encoder_decoder=True`), the possible\n            [`~utils.ModelOutput`] types are:\n    \n                - [`~generation.GreedySearchEncoderDecoderOutput`],\n                - [`~generation.SampleEncoderDecoderOutput`],\n                - [`~generation.BeamSearchEncoderDecoderOutput`],\n                - [`~generation.BeamSampleEncoderDecoderOutput`]\n\n"
